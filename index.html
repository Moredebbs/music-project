            <h3>Short story of how i fell in love with Music</h3>
            <p>
              I grew up in a non musical family i learnt some of the songs i
              knew from my elder brother who also love music. I have always
              known their is something special about my love for music but didnt
              realise this until i started to learn how to play the guitar in my
              fourth year in the univrsity. Since i laid my hands on the guitar
              i havent seems to have enough of it has i have been exploring
              different genre of music and learning to improve on myself ever
              since

                  I started learning this song december 2022 at first it sounds
                  almost impossible but as i break the song down into bits and
                  also slowed the speed i was able to achieve my goal of
                  learning this beautiful piece

                <p>
                  Here Comes the Sun" is a song by the English rock band the
                  Beatles from their 1969 album Abbey Road. It was written by
                  George Harrison and is one of his best-known compositions.
                  Harrison wrote the song in early 1969 at the country house of
                  his friend Eric Clapton, where Harrison had chosen to play
                  truant for the day to avoid attending a meeting at the
                  Beatles' Apple Corps organisation. The lyrics reflect his
                  relief at the arrival of spring and the temporary respite he
                  was experiencing from the band's business affairs.

                  It's almost impossible not to feel optimistic listening to
                  'Here Comes The Sun' - you can tangibly hear the sense of
                  relief about the seasons changing, or the new dawn beginning.
                  In recent years, the song has even provided solace and hope
                  for people living in dark, difficult times, as there's always
                  the prospect of a new day and a fresh start.

                  Once upon a time, you were a baby. Tiny, helpless, innocent; a
                  newborn human being. The most advanced activity you could do
                  was grasp your mom or dad’s finger with your tiny, chubby
                  hand. You were so small, your parents had to do everything for
                  you all the time. You needed them desperately simply to
                  survive. Yes, once you were a very vulnerable and needy child,
                  but that was a long time ago. Now, you can take care of
                  yourself much more than your newborn self could even come
                  close to. Especially if you’re a working, high functioning
                  adult, you may believe you can do most everything for yourself
                  now. But what if that belief is wrong? The fact is, our
                  independence is absolutely wonderful and feels amazing, and we
                  can celebrate that! Yet, we are in desperate need, even in our
                  independence, for God’s presence.d african community is and
                  how beautiful we share our lives together

                  The video goes beyond the EYO as a masquerade. Instead it
                  potrays the home the singer remembers she left in time past.
                  The streets, noises, fights and the people that forms what a
                  home means. The yellow bus,keke, traders, kids and of course
                  the EYO depicts her idea of Lagos, which she tightly holds
                  dear to her heart.

                  Despite the overbearing American culture which threatens
                  minority cultures all over the world, one aspect of our
                  national life that still lurks around is the communalistic
                  living passed down from generations before us. In European
                  countries, the societal values seem to have disintegrated to
                  the extent that it is said to be a situation of each man for
                  himself, a fact which apparently will sound strange to someone
                  coming from Nigeria. It is this motif that drives the song
                  ‘Eyo,’ and it is with it that Asa clothes the whole song.
